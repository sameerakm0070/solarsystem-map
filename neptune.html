<p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, classified as an ice giant. It is about 4 times wider than Earth, with a deep blue color from atmospheric methane, and experiences the solar system's strongest winds (up to 1,200 mph). Located 30 AU from the Sun, it takes ~165 Earth years to orbit.
