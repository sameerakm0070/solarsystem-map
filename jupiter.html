<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our solar system, with a mass over twice that of all other planets combined. As a gas giant with no solid surface, it consists mainly of hydrogen and helium, featuring a distinctive striped atmosphere with storms like the Great Red Spot.  </p>
