<p>Mercury can refer to the planet closest to the Sun or the heavy, silvery liquid metal element (Hg); the planet is the solar system's smallest, rocky, cratered world with extreme temperatures and no moons, orbiting fast, while the element is toxic, used in old thermometers, and can exist as a liquid at room temp, though it's a potent neurotoxin in organic forms like methylmercury found in fish, posing serious health risks.</p>
