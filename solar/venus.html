<p>Venus is Earth's "sister planet," similar in size but drastically different, known for its scorching hot, dense, carbon dioxide atmosphere, crushing pressure, and sulfuric acid clouds that create an intense greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet, even hotter than Mercury, with a surface of volcanoes and plains, and a unique slow, retrograde rotation. It's the brightest object in the night sky besides the Moon and orbits the Sun as the second planet. </p>
