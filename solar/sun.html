<p>The Sun is a 4.6-billion-year-old yellow dwarf star, the center of our solar system, providing vital light and heat through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making life possible on Earth. It's a massive ball of hot plasma, about 109 times Earth's diameter, holding 99.86% of the solar system's mass, and its gravity keeps planets in orbit.</p>
