<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, identified as a cold, windy ice giant with a unique 98-degree axial tilt that makes it spin on its side. Discovered in 1781 by William Herschel, it is four times wider than Earth, features 28 known moons, 13 faint rings, and has a methane-rich atmosphere giving it a cyan color.
